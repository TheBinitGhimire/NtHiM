## Installation

### Method 1: Using Pre-compiled Binaries
The pre-compiled binaries for different systems are available in the [**Releases**](https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/NtHiM/releases) page. You can download the one suitable for your system, unzip the file and start using NtHiM.

### Method 2: Using Crates.io
**NtHiM** is available on **[Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/NtHiM)**. So, if you have Rust installed on your system, you can simply install **NtHiM** with the following command:

```bash
cargo install NtHiM
```

### Method 3: Manual Build
You will need Cargo to perform the manual build for NtHiM.
If you have Cargo installed, you can simply follow the steps below:
1. Clone this repository, `git clone https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/NtHiM`;
2. Go inside the folder, `cd NtHiM`;
3. Use the `cargo build` command,
4. Go inside the newly-created **target** folder, and open the **debug** folder inside it, `cd target/debug`;
5. You will find **NtHiM.exe** (on Microsoft Windows) or **NtHiM** binary (on Linux).

The installation walkthrough for **NtHiM** has been uploaded to YouTube, covering all of these three methods, and you can watch the video here: **[How to Install and Use NtHiM (Now, the Host is Mine!)? Super Fast Sub-domain Takeover Detection!](https://youtu.be/CUTbqFhRjwY)**
