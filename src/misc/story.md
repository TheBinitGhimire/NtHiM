# Initiation

Back in January 2021, I had my semester examinations running, and I didn't want to study subjects that weren't of my interest, especially those related with electrical stuffs.

I had my exam of **Network Theory** on January 29, and I had no interest in preparing. Also, I was exploring things related with Rust at that time, and I thought about building a project with Rust in the gaps before the examination of this subject.

Before this, I had never built a single project with Rust, and not even written a "*Hello, world!*" program; so this would be my first Rust code/project back then.

This thought came right after the completion of my **Data Structures and Algorithms** exam on January 23, and I had my next exam in around 6 days. At this very moment, I got an idea of building a sub-domain takeover detection command-line utility, just for doing something I am passionate about rather than focusing on studies.

Along with that, I also knew I would be learning a lot of stuffs related with Rust while building this project. So, I started working on it, in around midnight of January 24 (*a few hours before January 25*).

By the midnight of January 25, the project was ready at its early stage, and I started working on the documentations, and published the initial release [**v0.0.1**](https://github.com/TheBinitGhimire/NtHiM/releases/tag/0.0.1) in the early morning of January 26.
